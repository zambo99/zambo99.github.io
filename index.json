On the street, at the office, in the car or in the train, at the airport or at home. IoT systems monitor our buildings, regulate traffic, listen to our conversations, deliver energy to our homes, and automate and operate our factories. Their applications and numbers increase by the hour, and we are quickly heading to a trillion devices deployed worldwide – approximately 150 devices per person on the planet.\nIncreasingly often, these devices are turned against us: spying on us, launching massive, distributed cyber-attacks, used as bridges to infect networks, employed in sophisticated nation-state attacks targeting our facilities We are losing control of our own infrastructure and soon we will be unable to manage the IoT we created. The sheer number of devices, their heterogeneity, and their varying longevity (days, or decades) represents a huge challenge impacting our personal safety, the security of our data, and our economy.\nWe are on the verge of losing the capacity of managing IoT: “Classic” constructs we used relatively successfully to manage IT systems, such as trust separation and graceful degradation, are now failing us, as they do not accommodate for the very characteristics and nature of IoT devices. There are several dimensions separating IoT from regular IT. In this context, the “old” IT-based security paradigm, based on ad-hoc solutions developed and deployed specifically for each system, is doomed to fail. In fact, it is already failing, as humans lose sight of the huge complexities characterizing such a heterogeneous, vast environment.\nSuch a multifaceted problem, needs to be tackled from different yet interrelated perspectives. To structure our approach, we align with the most recent edition of the National Cyber Security Research Agenda and we tackle the problem ‘integrally’ from various different, and complementary, perspectives: “Design”, “Defence”, “Attack”, “Governance”, and “Privacy”.\nDesign The state-of-the-art in secure software engineering is exemplified by lists of common security flaws, at the coding level or at the design level, e.g. the OWASP Top 10. There is even already an OWASP IoT Top 10, of things to avoid when building, deploying or managing IoT systems. Such lists, of what not to do, are still a long way off methodologies to get security-by-design. More constructive approaches, suggesting do’s rather than don’ts, include the BSIMM security maturity model and more recently the secure engineering methodology being developed by NIST and community efforts on assurance and certification in AMASS.\nWe need to move beyond Security-by-Design to Resilience-by-Design, while incorporating the autonomously adaptive security principle in our designs: We should expect systems to be attacked and compromised, in parts or as a whole, and design them to autonomously manage their security while acting selflessly. This means systems should be designed to allow for good monitoring to facilitate defence and to evolve in the face of new attacks, or rather, a better understanding of attacks. Our approach for this should be integrated with the NIST and AMASS initiatives mentioned above.\nUnfortunately, it is a well-known tragedy that the same standard security mistakes keep being repeated, and better practices keep being ignored. So we also need to understand why this is the case to make sure that new tools and techniques will not suffer the same fate. Insight into where and how incentives for secure practices are lacking also provides a basis for the perspective Governance.\nDefence In general defence is losing ground against attackers and in IoT specifically, defence is nearly non-existent. IoT offers a huge and heterogeneous attack surface, where standard ICT defence techniques are of limited applicability. Present defence techniques are very labour-intensive and as such they do not scale and cannot cope with the IoT specific dimensions of space, time and structure. Novel defence techniques are needed for IoT, addressing these dimensions while supporting autonomously and adaptive security. These techniques need to cope with the cyber-physical nature of the IoT setting, with potentially hostile environments, and the heterogeneous devices (low resource sensors, edge nodes, and powerful cloud back-ends).\nTo supervise devices that you do not manage, awareness of their behaviour and status is essential. Monitoring is thus an essential part of IoT defence. Current intrusion detection approaches, however, are not up to the task of efficiently monitoring the plethora of IoT devices and typically do not offer enough insight to make effective decisions, let alone to automate them. Today, we see the first steps in designing adaptive systems that respond to detected situations, however the underlying assumption that one has a full specification of the system, is not realistic in …","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"08da5ecab5f6fbba95f46d7b2a081408","permalink":"https://zambo99.github.io/project/intersect/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/intersect/","section":"project","summary":"Towards an Internet of Secure Things.","tags":["IoT Security"],"title":"INTERSCT","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funded by: NWO and DHS.\n2018 – 2022.\nProtecting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) requires solutions that not disturb existing operations, which is essential for large-scale systems and, especially for legacy systems.

The recent discovery of a malware called Stuxnet, show that these threats are already a reality. Their success in infiltrating Critical Infrastructure environments is calling attention on the ineffectiveness of standard security mechanisms at detecting them. Stuxnet is believed to have been operating undetected for almost one year leveraging multiple vulnerabilities that were previously unknown, and has been discovered only as a consequence to an operational anomaly that triggered the attention of the field operators. This fact clearly shows that our methods to find vulnerabilities and detect ongoing or successful attacks in critical infrastructure environments are not sufficient.\nCRISALIS focuses on these two aspects: detection of vulnerabilities and attacks in critical infrastructure environments. We focus on two different, yet interlinked, use cases that are typical for the power grid infrastructure: control systems based on SCADA protocols and the Advanced Metering Infrastructure. CRISALIS leverages the unique characteristics of critical infrastructure environments to produce novel practical mechanisms and techniques for their security assessment and protection. This is achieved by pursuing three main research objectives:\n providing new methodologies and techniques to secure critical infrastructure systems; providing new tools to detect intrusions; developing new, more effective, techniques to analyze infected systems.

Our tool can be integrated in COBIT-based risk assessment applications. Finally, we argue that our tool can be particularly useful for the dynamic auditing of the BCP.","tags":[],"title":"A Model Supporting Business Continuity Auditing and Planning in Information Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emmanuele Zambon","Damiano Bolzoni","Sandro Etalle","Marco Salvato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1179705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1179705600,"objectID":"0bae7a1ad93589d4ff50d285a8b2be52","permalink":"https://zambo99.github.io/publication/bdim2007/","publishdate":"2007-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bdim2007/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we define a method and a tool for carrying out a risk mitigation activity which allows us to assess the global impact of a set of risks and to choose the best set of countermeasures to cope with them. To this end, the presence of a tool is necessary, due to the high complexity of the assessment problem. Our approach can be integrated in present risk management methodologies (e.g. COBIT) to provide a more precise risk mitigation activity.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Based Mitigation of Availability Risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Damiano Bolzoni","Emmanuele Zambon","Sandro Etalle","Pieter Hartel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1144886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1144886400,"objectID":"2d23e8c29fc842d230e41d1ed7aed6b0","permalink":"https://zambo99.github.io/publication/iwia2006/","publishdate":"2006-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iwia2006/","section":"publication","summary":"We present POSEIDON, a new anomaly-based network intrusion detection system.
